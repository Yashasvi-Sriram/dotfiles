## description
The configuration of my linux machines.

## code
- `firstlove/`, `blackpanther/` contain configuration of respective machine.
- Most configuration is same across machines, except for some very machine specific things.

## usage
- The configuration of a machine evolves with time, improving workflow bit by bit.
- That is copied periodically to this repository and pushed to a remote location.
- If for some reason a machine needs to be wiped clean, the latest configuration can be fetched from the remote location.
